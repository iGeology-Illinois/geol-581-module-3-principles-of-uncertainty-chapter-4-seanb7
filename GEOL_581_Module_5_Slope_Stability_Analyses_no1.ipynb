        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will explore how to apply and compare different slope stability approaches, referencing the methods described in the textbook sections on kinematic and mechanical preconditions, plane/rotational sliding, and the method of slices (including Figs. 10.31–10.37, etc.). We will use Python to model:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Plane sliding in non-cohesive soils (and how friction angle and slope angle interplay).  \n",
        "- The method of slices in cohesive soils (membrane vs. flow net solutions).  \n",
        "- Sensitivity analyses, to see how factor of safety changes with varying parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some key ideas from the referenced pages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Kinematic and Mechanical Preconditions  \n",
        "   - A slope can fail only if it is capable of forming a particular failure mechanism (kinematic condition)  \n",
        "   - And if a trigger disturbs the force equilibrium (mechanical condition).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Plane Sliding vs. Rotational Sliding  \n",
        "   - Plane sliding is when the failure surface is roughly planar (Fig. 10.31, 10.32).  \n",
        "   - Rotational sliding is when the failure surface is curved, often occurring in cohesive soils (Fig. 10.34, 10.35).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Method of Slices  \n",
        "   - We divide the potential sliding mass into vertical slices.  \n",
        "   - Each slice’s forces (weight, cohesion, friction, pore-water pressures) are evaluated.  \n",
        "   - Two approaches, referencing Fig. 10.37:  \n",
        "     - Membrane solution: Groundwater is interpreted as acting along a membrane on the slip surface.  \n",
        "     - Flow net solution: Uses equipotential lines and flow nets to apply seepage forces directly within each slice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below, you will find three main coding tasks, each preceded by explanatory Markdown cells that guide your analysis. This assignment is deliberately open-ended so you can adapt or extend the models to more complex scenarios.\n"
