        "The following notebook builds on the concepts from the eight referenced textbook pages.  \n",
        "These sections expand on the physics of **plane sliding in rock mass**, examining situations where the sliding surface is constrained by joint sets (Figs. 10.39, 10.40, 10.41) and exploring **spatial (wedge) sliding** where two discontinuities intersect (Figs. 10.45, 10.46). There is also emphasis on **joint water pressure** (Figs. 10.42, 10.47), which can significantly reduce stability if water accumulates in discontinuities.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this assignment, you will write and modify Python code to handle:\n",
        "1. Plane sliding blocks with varying inclination, friction angles, and partial/ full joint water pressures.\n",
        "2. A simplified approach to wedge (spatial) sliding when two intersecting planes daylights the slope.\n",
        "3. Sensitivity analysis to see how joint water pressure, block geometry, or friction angles affect stability.\n",
        "\n",
        "You are not expected to provide a complete solution for each item, but rather to create well-structured code and clear explanations, demonstrating how you integrate the theoretical equations with computational approaches. Focus on how changes in input parameters alter the factor of safety and interpret your results with reference to the textbook figures and concepts.\n",
